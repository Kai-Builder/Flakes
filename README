Flakes is a very huge library for the STL (Standard template library) Which
adds many new features, as well as make a couple features more human readable.

FLOUR VS FLAKES

Flour is an old project i made when i was learning C. I made it with hopes of
allowing people to do things they may not have known.

Flakes is a C++ Implementation of many algorithms & Libraries which aid development.

To build the Flakes test projects, Do the following

$ make

If some files have their own Makefiles, Do the following.

$ cd <dir>
$ make <makefile>
